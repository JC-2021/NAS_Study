# NAS_Study

This project procides statistical analysis on NAS dataset.

Infants prenatally exposed to opiates were observed for the development of narcotic abstinence syndrome (NAS) and given supportive care. NAS is a group of conditions caused when a baby withdraws from certain drugs (most often opioids) that this baby is exposed to in the womb before birth. Besides opioids, NAS can also be caused by antidepressants (used to treat depression), barbiturates or benzodiazepines (sleeping pills). When mothers take these drugs during their pregnancies, those drugs can pass through the placenta and cause serious problems for their babies. Babies with NAS may have health conditions that need treatment in the newborn intensive care unit (NICU).

Auricular acupuncture facilitates narcotic withdrawal in opiate-dependent adults. Effects of auricular acupuncture in neonates with NAS are unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential efficacy of auricular acupressure augmentation of standard medical management of babies with NAS by comparing the length of hospital stay between babies randomized to receive standard medical care alone, or standard care plus auricular acupressure. We are also interested in identifying which factor(s) are related with the decreased length of hospital stay.

This study was investigated by using R language.
